# Neural-networks.
Implementations of perceptron algorithm with 2 layers for point sorting , with forward feeding, backpropagation and gradient descent,  
and k-means/LVQ algorithms for finding the closest neighbors and grouping them around specific points.

Also some sample files with respective outputs are provided.
